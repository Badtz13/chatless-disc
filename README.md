# Chatless Discord

A discord plugin I wrote to remove the chat from discord

It additionally causes the discord call pop-out to open when joining a call

I use this for my personal setup where I use Beeper for my discord channels, and
use Discord exclusively for calling.

It can be installed by first installing
[Better Discord](https://betterdiscord.app/) and then putting the file into the
plugins folder.
